                    <p>I am T'Asia Peace, a graphic desighner and visual artist with a degree in graphic deighn:digital media. For as long as i can remember art has been my passion, teaching myself new techniques and mediums was a hobby ive always enjoyed doing. I am constantly adapting and improving on my artistic skillset. I work with paints, traditional pencil and paper, charcole, digital and more. If there is a way to express yourself artistically then i probably played with it. My favorite way to express my self artisitically is threw digital art, using just a computer nearly anyhting is possible. my love for digital art is what sparked my curiousity for graphic desighn. At first i assumed that majoring in graphic desighn just meant making logos, banners, advertsments but it doesn't. Im learning that for me being in the graphic desighn field means learning new tools and art forms and im enjoying it. My goal is to be able to support myslef doing what i love in the art field. I want to continue learning and growing along with other who share my passion for the arts. I hope that one day i could work for a large company and get recognized for my work. I want to be the type of desighner that improves the world with thier skill and provides inspirations for the people that will come after.</p>

Saul Bass's style is very angular and abstract. He works very well with white space and utalizes alot of warm color tones and bold sihilloettes. I tried to match his overall style in my art.

I wanted to most prominently show The main characters transition from the the other world into her own, I wanted to showcase how the world within the gate is alot nicer and fair while her world is alot darker and mean.
